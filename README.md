# Obesity Analysis For Three Latin America Countries
Capstone Project For CIND 820 - Certificate in data analysis, big data, and predictive analysis TMU
 These are the stages of the project.
1- Problem Definition:
Define the problem you want to solve.
Understand the business requirements and objectives.
2- Data Collection:
Gather relevant data sources.
Ensure data quality and integrity.
3- Data Preprocessing:
Handle missing values.
Encode categorical variables.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
4- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Explore the dataset using statistical methods and visualizations.
Identify patterns, trends, and relationships in the data.
Gain insights into the dataset's characteristics.
5- Model Selection:
Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms based on the problem type (e.g., classification, regression).
Consider various models (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, neural networks) and their suitability for the problem.
6- Model Training:
Train the selected models using the training dataset.
Tune hyperparameters using techniques like cross-validation and grid search.
7- Model Evaluation:
Evaluate the trained models using appropriate evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score for classification; MSE, RMSE, RÂ² for regression).
Compare the performance of different models.
Model Interpretation:
Understand the trained models' behavior and decision-making process.
Interpret model predictions and feature importances.
